# Panel-by-Panel Reading Mode Feature

## Overview
Added a comprehensive panel-by-panel reading mode to the Comic Reader app, allowing users to navigate through individual comic panels with visual highlighting and smooth transitions.

## Features Added

### 1. Data Model Extensions
- **ComicPanel**: New data class representing individual panels within comic pages
- **PanelBounds**: Defines panel boundaries using percentage-based coordinates (0.0 to 1.0)
- **ReadingMode**: Enum to switch between PAGE and PANEL reading modes
- **Enhanced ComicPage**: Now includes a list of panels with sample panel layouts

### 2. Panel Navigation System
- **PanelNavigationState**: Comprehensive state management for panel navigation
  - Tracks current page and panel indices
  - Manages reading mode switching
  - Provides navigation methods (next/previous panel/page)
  - Calculates progress for both modes
  - Handles panel-to-panel transitions across pages

### 3. Visual Panel Overlay
- **PanelOverlay**: Custom Canvas-based component for panel visualization
  - Draws panel borders with animated highlighting
  - Shows current panel with red border, others with white borders
  - Handles different aspect ratios and image scaling
  - Smooth animations using Material 3 spring animations

### 4. Enhanced Comic Reader Screen
- **Reading Mode Toggle**: Icon button in top app bar to switch between modes
- **Smart Tap Detection**: 
  - In panel mode: Tap panels to navigate directly to them
  - In page mode: Tap left/right for page navigation
  - Center tap: Toggle UI visibility
- **Adaptive Controls**: Navigation buttons change based on reading mode
- **Progress Tracking**: Shows panel progress in panel mode, page progress in page mode

### 5. Sample Data
- **Diverse Panel Layouts**: 4 different panel layout types:
  - Full page panel
  - Two horizontal panels
  - Three panels (top full, bottom split)
  - Four panels in grid layout
- **Realistic Panel Bounds**: Percentage-based coordinates for responsive layouts

## Technical Implementation

### Panel Detection Algorithm
```kotlin
fun findPanelAtPoint(
    panels: List<ComicPanel>,
    tapPoint: Offset,
    canvasSize: Size,
    imageSize: Size
): Int?
```
- Converts tap coordinates to image-relative coordinates
- Checks which panel contains the tap point
- Handles different image aspect ratios and scaling

### Navigation State Management
```kotlin
class PanelNavigationState {
    var readingMode: ReadingMode
    var currentPageIndex: Int
    var currentPanelIndex: Int
    
    fun nextPanel(): Boolean
    fun previousPanel(): Boolean
    fun toggleReadingMode()
    // ... more methods
}
```

### Visual Highlighting
- Animated panel borders using Canvas drawing
- Red highlight for current panel
- Semi-transparent white borders for other panels
- Smooth fade in/out animations

## User Experience

### Panel Reading Mode
1. **Activation**: Tap the panel icon in the top app bar
2. **Navigation**: 
   - Tap any panel to jump directly to it
   - Use "Next Panel"/"Prev Panel" buttons
   - Automatic page transitions when reaching panel boundaries
3. **Visual Feedback**: Current panel highlighted with red border
4. **Progress**: Shows "Panel X/Y â€¢ Page A/B" format

### Page Reading Mode
1. **Traditional Navigation**: Tap left/right sides of screen for page navigation
2. **Button Controls**: "Previous"/"Next" buttons for page navigation
3. **Progress**: Shows "Page X of Y" format

## Code Structure

### New Files Added
- `app/src/main/java/com/comicreader/app/ui/components/PanelOverlay.kt`
- `app/src/main/java/com/comicreader/app/ui/components/PanelNavigationState.kt`

### Modified Files
- `app/src/main/java/com/comicreader/app/data/Comic.kt` - Extended data models
- `app/src/main/java/com/comicreader/app/ui/screens/reader/ComicReaderScreen.kt` - Enhanced reader

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Auto Panel Detection**: Use image processing to automatically detect panel boundaries
2. **Panel Zoom**: Automatically zoom to fit current panel in view
3. **Reading Direction**: Support for right-to-left reading (manga style)
4. **Panel Animations**: Smooth transitions between panels with guided focus
5. **Accessibility**: Voice navigation and screen reader support for panels
6. **Panel Metadata**: Add panel descriptions, speech bubbles, sound effects
7. **Smart Panel Order**: AI-powered reading order detection for complex layouts

### Performance Optimizations
1. **Panel Caching**: Pre-calculate panel bounds for faster navigation
2. **Lazy Loading**: Load panel data only when needed
3. **Memory Management**: Optimize overlay rendering for large comics

## Testing

### Manual Testing Steps
1. Open any comic in the reader
2. Tap the panel icon (ViewQuilt) in the top app bar
3. Verify panel borders appear on the comic page
4. Tap different panels to navigate between them
5. Use navigation buttons to move between panels
6. Test panel navigation across page boundaries
7. Switch back to page mode and verify normal page navigation works
8. Test with different comic pages to see various panel layouts

### Edge Cases Handled
- Pages with no panels (falls back to page mode behavior)
- Single panel pages
- Panel navigation at comic boundaries
- Image loading states
- Different screen sizes and orientations

## Material 3 Integration
- Uses Material 3 spring animations for smooth transitions
- Follows Material Design color schemes for panel highlighting
- Integrates with existing Material 3 theme and components
- Maintains consistent visual language with rest of the app
